  abstract = {The capabilities for visualization, rapid data retrieval, and manipulation in geographic information systems (GIS) have created the need for new techniques of exploratory data analysis that focus on the ``spatial'' aspects of the data. The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Giand G*istatistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {The relationship between house price and location is very complicated. Traditional theory mainly emphasizes the relationship between the effects of accessibility to central locations on housing prices and ignores location-specific attributes of housing. Previous studies at best examine only one or a few environmental amenities. However, little has been done on a high-rise, densely populated living environment. This paper thus aims to investigate the ``neighboring and environmental characteristics'' of a residential property on its market value in such unique setting. It uses a more advanced approach---i.e. a hedonic model with spatial adjustments---and applies GIS techniques. The findings are mostly consistent with our hypotheses. The traveling time from the apartment to the central business district is negatively correlated with housing price. Households are also willing to pay more for apartments with sea view and better air. However, greenbelt is not a significant variable on housing price and noise level is even found to be positively correlated with the price. This unexpected finding may be explained by the uniquely dense living environment in Hong Kong where households are willing to sacrifice serenity for convenience. The current research is adequately sophisticated and has contributed to a better understanding of the important theoretical question of how much a household is willing to spend on various environmental and neighbourhood attributes of an apartment.},

  abstract = {AbstractVarious public transport (PT) agencies publish their route and timetable information with the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) as the standard open format. Timetable data are commonly used for PT passenger routing. They can also be used for studying the structure and organization of PT networks, as well as the accessibility and the level of service these networks provide. However, using raw GTFS data is challenging as researchers need to understand the details of the GTFS data format, make sure that the data contain all relevant modes of public transport, and have no errors. To lower the barrier for using GTFS data in research, we publish a curated collection of 25 cities' public transport networks in multiple easy-to-use formats including network edge lists, temporal network event lists, SQLite databases, GeoJSON files, and the GTFS data format. This collection promotes the study of how PT is organized across the globe, and also provides a testbed for developing tools for PT network analysis and PT routing algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the space-time dynamics of the European digital divide. The frequencies of internet and E-commerce use are considered, along with a broad range of indicators associated with the European digital single market strategy. This paper aims to investigate the spatial structure underlying these aggregate outcome indicators. An exploratory spatial data analysis is conducted in a sample of 209 regions using Eurostat data. Strong evidence for both global and local spatial autocorrelation is found for the years 2011--2016. Consistently, a North-South polarization scheme is identified with little statistical significance in the centre of Europe. This contrasts with the high income cluster found in central Europe, while low values for digital indices and income are co-located more consistently in the South, but also in the North-East. Highlights from the specific results include: areas surrounding London as a dynamic high value cluster in E-commerce, Italy to conduct few cross-border purchases, France as a consistent adopter of E-governance, and broadband rates in general to closely reflect online activities.},

  abstract = {Urban mobility increasingly relies on multimodality, combining the use of bicycle paths, streets, and rail networks. These different modes of transportation are well described by multiplex networks. Here we propose the overlap census method which extracts a multimodal profile from a city's multiplex transportation network. We apply this method to 15 cities, identify clusters of cities with similar profiles, and link this feature to the level of sustainable mobility of each cluster. Our work highlights the importance of evaluating all the transportation systems of a city together to adequately identify and compare its potential for sustainable, multimodal mobility.},
